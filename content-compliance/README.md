# content-compliance

Content Compliance: an agent skill for Vitra Universe. Checks content against each market's rules before it goes out, with the Vitra Universe API: text, images, audio and video are scored per market (approved, review or blocked) with the rules they break and the frames or media that break them, plus unsafe-content detection; a flagged image can be regenerated to meet a market's rules; past checks are listed or deleted; and reviewers' own verdicts on the review queue are relayed.

Drop this folder into your agent's skills directory. The agent reads `SKILL.md`
and does the rest; you don't run anything by hand.

## How it works

Every step is a Vitra server tool (the same tools the Vitra MCP connector
offers). The skill only guides the agent through them:

- `scripts/vitra.py` forwards each call to the tools route of the Vitra API
  (`/v1/agent/tools`) and prints one JSON object. `tools`, `describe`, `call`,
  `upload` and `download` are its commands.
- `scripts/login.py` signs this machine in to one Vitra organization.

Anything that spends credits is priced first and needs your yes.

## Sign in

```bash
python3 scripts/login.py            # opens the browser: sign in, pick the organization
python3 scripts/login.py --status   # who is signed in, where
python3 scripts/login.py --logout
```

No browser (a server, a container)? An organization owner or admin creates an
API key in Vitra under Settings -> API keys; set it where the agent runs:

```bash
export VITRA_UNIVERSE_API_KEY=uvk_your_key_here
```

The key acts with its creator's role in that one organization. Keep it secret.

## Requirements

Python 3.10+, standard library only. Outbound HTTPS to the Vitra API.
